Cloudformation
======

Couple of cloud formation templates that I have used over the years

Cloud formation is a powerful tool to ensure consistent configurations of your vms in openstack and aws.  
  
## Example
- The almstack.json example will allow you to spin up an environment with freeipa server as the central authentication server, and Jenkins as the build server
- The coreos.json example will allow you to spin up a coreos cluster on openstack or aws.  Just change the cluster size parameters and network ids and you good to go. 
- The jenkins.json example will allow you to spin up a jenkins host on openstack or aws.
